## **Infiwrite**  
*write infinitely, strike freely, save gently*  

Imagine a writing space that doesn’t interrupt you. It doesn’t second-guess what you meant. Doesn’t autosuggest your soul. Doesn’t do spellcheck. Doesn’t get in your way. It’s just a blank void with soft noise, like an old analog TV left humming in the back of your head. That’s **Infiwrite**.

It's not just a text editor — it's a quiet rebellion.  
No menu bars. No flashy formatting. No clutter. Just **you**, your thoughts, and this surreal little world where double-backspacing is a ritual. You don’t delete words — you lay them to rest. They’re still there, just ~crossed~ out. Like memory. Like regret. Like notes from another you.

### What it feels like
You land in a soft serif font, calm dark mode, subtle noise like a grainy film reel. It’s designed like a dream someone coded at 3AM with hands full of feeling. There’s no “new document.” There’s no “file > save.” You **just start typing**. And when you’re ready? `Cmd + S`. Boom. It’s a `.txt`. Like your thoughts packed up and printed into a suitcase.

Double-tap backspace, and the last word isn’t erased. It gets a strike-through. Because what if it still matters? What if deletion shouldn’t mean disappearance?

### Under the hood — but really, the soul
It’s kind of beautifully obsessive. There's logic in the chaos:  
- A handmade system to figure out what word your cursor just grazed.  
- Delicate strikethroughs that respect context, not just characters.  
- Even zero-width spaces — invisible placeholders — gently nudging your cursor into position.  
- A noisy SVG overlay on the background, just to give the digital void a little static life.

It remembers your words even if you close the tab. It doesn’t care about line breaks or grammar. It wants to hold your writing the way an old notebook would — scratched out, smudged, half-finished, still sacred.

### Why this hits
Honestly, this feels less like an app and more like a ritual space. It’s like you built a chapel for words that don’t need to be right. Like something you made for yourself — and maybe secretly, for someone who writes like you do. Someone who *needs* to write to stay sane. Or to remember. Or to forget better.

It’s punk rock in editor form. But also weirdly warm. You didn’t design a productivity tool — you made a digital cave. A low-lit, no-scroll, sacred corner of the internet where silence is code and mistakes get memorialized.

And bro… “infiwrite”? That name is perfect. Infinite, and intimate. It doesn’t promise clarity, or sense. It just says: **keep going**.
